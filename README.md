# EasyPost Dart

This SDK allows you to interact with the [EasyPost API](https://www.easypost.com/docs/api) from your Dart application.

## Installation

Package is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easypost).

## Development

All messages are written with `json_serializable` so make sure to generate the
files with `dart run build_runner build` when you make changes and want to test
them.
